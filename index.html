        <h1>Jean Bartik</h1>
        <p>Jean Bartik was best known for being one of the six original programmers to work on the ENIAC machine. The six original programmers consisted solely of females, as a result of a lack of male programmers due to them being sent away to help in the war effort. This gave opportunity to females, that otherwise would have been redundent, to show their abilities in the absence of men, which paid off in the end. However, regardless of the progress that the programmers made, this was not credited in their lifetimes and recognition has only been awarded in recent years. Later in her career, Bartik became an advocate for the recognition of womenâ€™s work in the early years of computer science.
